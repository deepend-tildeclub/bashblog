Post a markdown file:

.An man page by Vlad Me»ôco Aq Pa alzwded@tilde.club
.Sh CAVEATS
The tilde.club version imposes that the
.Pa blog
root directory is
.Sm off
.Pa ~/public_html/blog
,
.Sm on
and it will
.Xr cd 1
to that directory before doing anything else. This makes all
.Pa paths
be relative to that directory.
.Pp
As a side effect, if the
.Pa ~/public_html/blog/
directory does not exist,
.Nm
will get confused and dump files where you don't expect them. Make sure
you create that path before running
.Sm off
.Nm
:
.Sm on
.Dl mkdir -p ~/public_html/blog/
.Pp
Post file names might get de-unicoded, so if
.Nm
complains it couldn't find your file, use
.Xr find 1
or
.Xr grep 1
in
.Pa ~/public_html/blog/
to find them.
